2. “historyCuts.csv” - Subjects who didn't follow directions on history quiz; identified by manual inspection.
3. "ReadMe.txt" - The file you're currently reading.
4. "stateDemoData.csv" - Statistics for each state on population, wealth, size, year in union, etc. Used with the analysis script. 
5. “State Narcissism Analysis” - R script for running analyses for data. (a)
6. “State Narcissism Data Scrub.R” - R script for scrubbing data.
7. “State Narcissism Follow Up Data” - Data and summary statistics from the follow up project (b).
8. “State Narcissism Raw Data.csv” - Raw data output from Qualtrics (c).
9. “State Narcissism Scrubbed Data.csv” - Data after being processed by data scrub script.
10. "State Narcissism (PDF).pdf - PDF file of the survey.
11. "State Narcissism (Qualtrics).qsf - Copy of survey in qualtrics format.



NOTES
(a) The data scrub script must be in the same folder as the raw output file and the historyCuts file in order to run correctly. Note that running this script will generate multiple .CSV files that are later imported by the analysis script. In other words, you always need to run the scrub script before running the analysis script.
(b) The summary tab contains the summary of the key data
(c) Personally identifying information (IP Address, MTurk ID) has been removed, but otherwise this file is identical to the Qualtrics output file.



PAPER ABSTRACT
Collective narcissism—a phenomenon where individuals show excessive high regard for their own group—is ubiquitous in studies of small groups. We examined how Americans from the 50 U.S. states (N = 2,898) remembered United States history by asking them: “In terms of percentage, what do you think was your home state’s contribution to the history of the United States?” The mean state estimates ranged from 9% (Iowa) to 41% (Virginia), with the total contribution for all states equaling 907%, indicating strong collective narcissism. In comparison, ratings provided by non-residents for states were much lower (but still high). Surprisingly, asking people questions about United States history before they made their judgment did not lower estimates. We argue that this ethnocentric bias is due to ego-protection, selective memory retrieval processes involving the availability heuristic, and poor statistical reasoning. This study shows that biases that influence individual remembering also influence collective remembering.
