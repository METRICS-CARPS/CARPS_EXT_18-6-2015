For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section pertaining to "Resident and nonresident estimates of state contributions to U.S. history".

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Resident and nonresident estimates ofstate contributions to U.S. history.The average estimated contribution for residents fromall states was 18.25%, 95% CI = [17.53%, 18.97%]. Summingthe average contribution from all states (whichlogically should equal 100%) yielded an astounding907%, indicating a strong bias to overclaim responsibility.The estimates from different states also rangedwidely. Figure 1 provides a heat map showing the estimatedresident contribution for each state (more detailsare available in Table S1 in the Supplemental Material).Iowans gave the lowest rating at 9%, whereas Virginiansgave the highest rating at 41%, indicating that statesshowed highly variable estimates of responsibility. Ofcourse, Virginians have contributed more to Americanhistory than Iowans, but these judged percentages arestill quite high. The editor of this journal referred tosuch high numbers as “ludicrous,” and he has a point—Virginians and Iowans together were not responsiblefor 50% of U.S. history. Still, these consistently highnumbers came from people in all 50 states.Of course, there was also variability within a statein how people responded. Figure 2 shows the aggregatehistogram of data from all 50 states, revealing a strongpositive skew. Although most estimates (72%) werebelow or equal to 20%, there were a number of muchhigher responses, particularly in eastern states (e.g.,Virginia, Delaware, and Massachusetts), indicating thatsome people thought that their home states had madehugely significant contributions to U.S. history.
